## photo tagging

### approach 1

- html usermap lets us click certain areas of an image
- get coordinate pixels
  flag image
  - 884, 75
  - 889, 71
  - 900, 68
  - 909, 66
  - 915, 63
  - 921, 60
  - 924, 75
  - 927, 82
  - 909, 89
  - 892, 97

### approach 2

- make the complete image clickable
- on click, get the coordinates where user clicked
- save the min and max percentage values that the image takes
- if the clicked coordinate lies inside the min and max values
  - then the image has been clicked
- else keep looking

lets take the flag as an example
min --> (45, 12)
max --> (47, 19)
